<p>
	The images shown in this column are a visual representation of all the
	data sets supporting the coexpression results. Each experiment that was
	queried is representd by either a black line or a gap. A black line is
	shown if that experiment contributes to the support for the
	coexpression for the gene pair. A gap is shown if it does not.

<p>
	The graphic for each gene is shown in the same expression experiment
	ordering, so you can look along vertical 'tracks' to see which
	experiments contribute to many of the links.
