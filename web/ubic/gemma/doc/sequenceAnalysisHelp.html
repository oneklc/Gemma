<p>
	The sequence analysis report summarizes our gene assignment analysis
	for the current platform. This summary is broken down into categories
	described below. Details of the analysis procedure are given elsewhere.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Probes:</strong>The number of elements on the array that form
		the primary analytical unit. This number aggregates features that
		belong to so-called "composite sequences", so on Affymetrix array
		designs this corresponds to "probe sets".
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong> Probes with sequences: </strong> The number of probes that
		have a provided sequence. For some platforms, sequences are
		missing for some or all of its probes.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong> Probes with genome alignments: </strong> The number of probes
		whose sequences provide an alignment to the genome. Some probe-genome
		alignments do not necessarily meet stringency requirements and are not
		included in the database.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong> Probes mapping to genes: </strong> Of probes with alignments,
		how many are mapped to known genes.
		
		<!-- predicted genes, and probe-aligned
		regions (a breakdown is provided). "Known genes" include RefSeq or
		other annotated genes. "Predicted gene" based on computational
		analyses. A "probe-aligned region" (PAR) is an 'anonymous' genomic
		region that does not fall into the other categories. Given a
		particular alignment, a predicted gene or PAR is only assigned to a
		probe if it does not map to a known or predicted gene. However, a
		probe can be assigned "genes" from all categories when there are
		multiple good alignments to the genome. -->
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong> Unique genes represented </strong> The number of distinct
		known genes, predicted genes, and probe-aligned regions represented on
		the array. This number can be higher or lower than the number of
		probes mapping because some probes can map to multiple genes, and some
		genes have more than one probe mapping.
	</li>
</ul>
