	The <strong>support</strong> for a pair of coexpressed genes is the number of distinct 
	datasets that the gene pair is coexpressed in.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Positive Correlation</strong> A green number indicates a positive correlation
		between the two genes.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Negative Correlation: </strong> A red number indicates a negative correlation 
		between the two genes.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong> Adjusted  support</strong> The italicized  number in brackets  is the adjusted  support.
		As probes on an array are non-specific (can hybridize to multiple genes), the adjusted  support 
		only counts datasets that contain at least one specific probe (1-1 mapping between probe and gene)
		for the coexpressed gene in question.  Therefore the adjusted  support helps rule out possible false 
		positives.
