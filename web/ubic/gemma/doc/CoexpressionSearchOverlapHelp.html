<p>
	The
	<strong>GO Overlap %</strong> for a pair of co-expressed genes is a
	measure of similarity of the genes, based on prior knowledge. Here it
	is computed as the percentage of overlap between the Gene Ontology
	terms (including all parents) for that Gene pair (queried and
	co-expressed gene).
</p>
<p>
	The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of common GO terms
	by the total number of unique GO terms (including parents) that the
	queried gene has. Values might not be computed for all (or any) of your
	results, in which case a "-" is shown.
